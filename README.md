# The ENS Spitzer

Ever wondered how many domains have been registered on the ENS to date? How much people have spent generating domains? How about how much money has been spent trading domains or who the biggest spender in the ENS user pool is?

You can find the answer to all those questions here!

Go and grab a domain on ens.domains, or bid on one that's already taken on OpenSea.

Stay in touch on Twitter @eliasimos and if you're feeling generous, nudge me on elias.eth.

Not all of the domains registered are available on Dune by name, as of yet. As such while I have estimated the total number of domains generated to be ~330k, the statistics to the left and right here are extracted from a subset of ~5.5k registered names.

Dune can easily grab any contract. For this section, we currently count from ethereumnameservice.DefaultReverseResolvercallsetName aka contract 0x5fbb459c49bb06083c33109fa4f14810ec2cf358 and would love to get info on where there might be more names.

If you have info here, get in touch with @eliasimos or @DuneAnalytics.

I will try and keep this updated as more ENS contracts become available.

Feel free to roam around, fork and update some queries or add your own metrics and ideas.
